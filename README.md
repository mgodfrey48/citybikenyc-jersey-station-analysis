# CityBikeNYC New Jersey Stations
This repo contains code used to clean and merge CityBikeNYC data from 2019-2021. Specifically, the analysis performed with this data looks at users from Jersey City. 

Using pandas, I read in csv files containing usage data downloaded from CitiBikenyc.com, clean them up for consistency and clarity, and finally merge the data into one dataframe to be exported. Unfortunately the exported data file containing info from 2019-2021 was too large to add to this repo, but I have included the data files I downloaded here.

After exporting the data, I used Tableau to create some visualizations and dashboards to display analysis of the data. The visualizations and dashboards can be found on my Tableau Public profile: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/matt.godfrey4551/viz/CitiBikeAnalysis19_21/JerseyCityStory

Below are two examples of the visualizations on Tableau.
